Hey there, I'm Sergio (stylized `zrgio`), I'm a software and hardware developer from Chile :chile:

Currently looking for a job, and learning more about my hobbies in my free time

## What I know

When it comes to hardware, I'm experienced with CAD desing, circuit & PCB design, embedded development, and a tad of product design.

But nowadays I mostly focus on sofware development. My language of choice is Go, but I also know Python and I'm somewhat experienced with C++.

## What I'm currently learning

- SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- Docker
